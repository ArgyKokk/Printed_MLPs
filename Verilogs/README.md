# Verilog design for each dataset when:
* only pruning is applied
* only quantization is applied
* only ours hw aware weight sharing is applied
* only the weight clustering (https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/clustering) is applied
* The estimated Pareto front of our proposed methodology are generated
